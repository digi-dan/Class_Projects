This program creates Animal Objects. Some animals are defined in their own respective classes however there is an Animal class which is used for animals that do not have their own specific class. Each animal has the function of eating, sleeping, moving, and making sound. There is also interfaces (Domesticated, Swimmer, Scratcher) which are implemented in some classes which give some animals extra functions. AnimalTest file tests these objects by instantiating certain animals and calling on their functions.
